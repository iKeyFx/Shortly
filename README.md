## My Process

### Built With

- **Vue.js** - JavaScript framework for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **TinyURL API** - Used to shorten the URLs.
- **Mobile-first workflow** - Ensured the design is responsive across all devices.
- **Local Storage** - To persist shortened links even after refreshing the browser.

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:

- **Vue.js Composition API**: I used Vue's reactive system to manage state and handle form submissions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I learned how to efficiently use utility classes to create responsive designs.
- **API Integration**: I successfully integrated the TinyURL API to shorten URLs dynamically.
- **Local Storage**: I implemented local storage to save and retrieve shortened links, ensuring they persist across page reloads.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- **Advanced State Management**: Exploring Vuex or Pinia for more complex state management.
- **Testing**: Implementing unit and end-to-end tests using tools like Jest and Cypress.
- **Performance Optimization**: Learning more about optimizing web performance, especially for larger applications.
